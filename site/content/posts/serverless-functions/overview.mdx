Serverless functions are an approach to writing back-end code that doesn't require writing a back-end.

In the simplest terms: we write a function using our preferred language, like JavaScript; we send that function to a serverless provider; and then we can call that function just like any API using HTTP methods.

This is _huge_ for front-end developers. We're now able to add powerful "back-end" logic to our apps just by writing JavaScript — no devops, no server code, no fuss.

This _also_ means that our JAMstack apps gain all the benefits that come along with server-hosted apps, but with significantly lower setup and maintenance costs. We can deploy in seconds using [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=TKTK&utm_medium=serverless-intro-jl&utm_campaign=devex) and use our serverless functions immediately.

Put another way: serverless functions turn front-end developers into full-stack developers _without requiring us to learn or manage the full stack_.
